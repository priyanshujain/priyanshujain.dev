              For a brief period I was doing research in the field of matching
              algorithms and wrote two papers on applications of matching
              algorithms in healthcare(organ exchanges).
              <br />
              In the past, my research has been applied in developing document

              free to comment your thoughts too. I believe that every tool,
              programming language, and framework is just that‚Äîa tool. The best
              software doesn't get bogged down in the specifics of the tools it
              uses. Instead, it focuses on solving the actual problem at hand.
              Tools should serve the software, not the other way around. This is
              why companies like Basecamp have thrived‚Äîthey use simple,
              well-understood tools to solve real problems, rather than chasing
              the latest trends or technologies.

              I'm a sports enthusiast and have experience of running many
              marathons and triathlons(üèäüö¥üèÉ). I did an Ironman 70.3 in 2022.
              This started as a channel to get out of the house and get some
              exercise during covid, but it has since become a serious hobby.
              Last few years, I have been training for running and triathlons. I
              have been part of running groups and have participated in more
              than 40 sporting events.

              This has been a great way to meet new people, stay fit, and push
              myself to new limits. This year I started training for mountains
              and have been doing some high altitude treks in Himalayas. I
              enrolled in a mountaineering course at HMI Darjeeling (starting
              Dec 2024) and have been training for it for the last few months.

              <p className="f4 f3-ns sig-grey">
              Beyond my work in tech, I am committed to giving back. I am a big
              believer of effective altruism‚Äîusing evidence and reason to figure
              out how to benefit others the most and taking action on that
              basis. I allocate a portion of my income (5-10%) for various
              causes. My main focus is on sports and education. I have been
              supporting a few national athletes and students in their journey.
              <br />
              <br />
              Fun fact: I always donate my old laptops to underprivileged
              students. I believe that technology can be a great equalizer.
              <br />
              <br />
              Apart from this I founded PlayTogether, a platform dedicated to
              supporting underprivileged athletes by connecting them with
              resources and opportunities. It's my way of merging my passion for
              sports with a mission to level the playing field.
