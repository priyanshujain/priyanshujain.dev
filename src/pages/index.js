              I am pjay, a software developer and an advocate for
              technology-driven impact. I sometimes <a href="/writings">write</a> about software, philosophy, and sports.
              <br />

              <h4 className="f3 sig-blue">Programmer</h4>
              For a brief period I was doing research in the field of matching algorithms and wrote two papers
              on applications of matching algorithms in healthcare(organ exchanges).
              <br />
              In the past, my research has been applied in developing document parsing algorithms(resumes)
              and auditing systems for international payments(rate markup calculations).

              <br />
              <br />
              Over the years, I've co-founded a startup, navigated the ups and downs of the startup world,
              and built products spanning financial softwares, payment platforms, and cloud infrastucture.
              <br />
              I currently work at <a href="https://okcredit.in" target="_blank">OkCredit</a> {` `}
              where I work as Principal Engineer and responsible for backend, security and infrastucture things.
              <br />
              <br />
              I am a big fan of open source. I build and maintain a few open source projects :-

              <ul style={{
                marginTop: '8px',
              }}>

              I idetify myself a software philosopher and always ponder about the complexity of software systems and what makes a software great.
              I have this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mi8WUGGw0D3kW8AQZY4ThVncu1cFFQVj3O1hnr2SdnI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">
                live document</a> where I keep adding my thoughts on ideal software systems. Feel free to comment your thoughts too.

              I believe that every tool, programming language, and framework is just that‚Äîa tool. 
              The best software doesn't get bogged down in the specifics of the tools it uses. Instead,
               it focuses on solving the actual problem at hand. Tools should serve the software, not the 
               other way around. This is why companies like Basecamp have thrived‚Äîthey use simple,
                well-understood tools to solve real problems, rather than chasing the latest trends 
                or technologies.

              <h4 className="f3 sig-blue">Athlete</h4>
              I'm a sports enthusiast and have experience of running many marathons and triathlons(üèäüö¥üèÉ). I did an Ironman 70.3 in 2022.
              This started as a channel to get out of the house and get some for exercise during covid, but it has since become a serious hobby.
              
              Last few years, I have been training for running and triathlons.
               I have been part of running groups and have participated in more than 40 sporting events.

                maxWidth: '360px',
                margin: '20px auto',
                borderRadius: '8px',
               }} />}

              <br />
              This has been a great way to meet new people, stay fit, and push myself to new limits. This year 
              I started training for mountains and have been doing some high altitude treks in Himalayas.
              I enrolled in a mountaineering course at HMI Darjeeling (starting Dec 2024) and have been training for it for the last few months.

              <h4 className="f3 sig-blue">Effective Altruist</h4>
              Beyond my work in tech, I am committed to giving back.
              I am a big believer of effective altruism‚Äîusing evidence and reason to figure out 
              how to benefit others the most and taking action on that basis. I allocate a portion of my income (5-10%) for various causes.
              My main focus is on sports and education. I have been supporting a few national athletes and students in their journey.
               <br />
               <br />
              Fun fact: I always donate my old laptops to underprivileged students. I believe that technology can be a great equalizer.
              <br />
              <br />
              Apart from this  I founded PlayTogether, a platform dedicated to supporting underprivileged athletes 
              by connecting them with resources and opportunities. It's my way of merging my passion for
               sports with a mission to level the playing field.
