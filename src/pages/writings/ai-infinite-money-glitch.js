                            OpenAI signed a deal to buy roughly $300 billion of cloud compute from Oracle over the next few years.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Oracle's stock ripped up about 36% in one day, its biggest single-day gain since 1992.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            To run that capacity Oracle is placing huge orders for Nvidia chips. It put the first batch at roughly $40 billion for a Texas data center.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Nvidia, valued around $4.4â€“4.5 trillion, is itself committing up to $100 billion to OpenAI and will be both supplier and investor.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The net effect looks like a self-reinforcing loop: OpenAI pays Oracle for compute, Oracle pays Nvidia for GPUs, and Nvidia funnels capital back into OpenAI. Capital ping-pongs between the three and in the process locks in customers, capacity, and market power.
