                            Agents donâ€™t copy and paste the way humans do. When we have to move a block of code from one file to another file. A human doing this refactor would select the original text, cut it, move to the new file, and paste it.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Coding agents typically operate this by emitting patches a deletion in the source file and an insertion in the target file. Two separate operations. That split creates room for mistakes (off-by-one deletions, context mismatches, ordering/race issues, or misinterpreted ranges).
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The solution would be making the clipboard a first-class tool for agents. If an agent can copy a block to a clipboard and then paste it, it preserves the exact text and avoids interpretation errors that arise from reconstructing code with separate patches.
