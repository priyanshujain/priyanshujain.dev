I used to ride a bike all my life for commuting but never rode a\n                bike more than 15-20 kilometres.\n                <br />\n                so one weekend I borrowed a road bike and went for a ride.\n                I was aiming to ride 50 kilometres to see how it feels to ride bike for long distance.\n                I kept riding and thinking that I will turn back after 25 kilometres but I was enjoying the ride so much that\n                I reached Bangalore Airport that is almost 50 kilometres and I was still enjoying it. I turned back and rode back to my home.\n                This was the first time I rode a bike for 100 kilometres. I was tired but I was happy that I was able to do it. \n                <br />\n                <br />\n                <div style={{\n                  width: \"100%\",\n                  maxWidth: \"100%\",\n                  textAlign: \"center\",\n                }}>\n                {<Icon name=\"PHOTO-Airport.jpg\" style={{\n                  maxWidth: \"400px\",\n                }} />}\n                <span\n                style={{\n                  fontSize: \"1.4rem\",\n                  fontStyle: \"italic\",\n                  display: \"block\",\n                }}\n              >\n                This was my first time going to Bangalore Airport on a bike.\n              </span>\n                </div>\n              <br />\n              <br />\n\n              I used to watch running videos on YouTube on this channel called\n              Global Triathlon Network(GTN), that's where I first heard about\n              Triathlons. There was something about the sport that was very\n              intriguing to me. I was always fascinated by the idea of pushing\n              my body to the limit and see how far I can go.\n              <br />\n              There was a new video on GTN about preparing for an half Ironman.\n              I was fascinated by the idea of doing a triathlon and started\n              researching about it.\n                <br />\n                <br />\n                <b>So what is a Ironman?</b> It's a triathlon that consists of 1.9 km of swimming,\n                90 km of cycling and 21.1 km of running, and it has to be completed in 8 hours.\n                Ironman is the gold standard of triathlons and it's the most difficult triathlon.\n                But more I read about it, more I was fascinated by it.\n                <br />\n                The only Ironman even I found in India about was Ironman 70.3 Goa that was scheduled in October 2022.\n                It was all set in my mind that I will do it.\n                <br />\n                <br />\n              But the challenge was that I have been barely able to swim 10 metres, never rode a road bike\n              and only practicing running for few months.\n              I remember my 100km biking experience and I was confident that I can do it.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              My biggest challenge was swimming. I have never swam in my life and I was scared of water.\n                I was not sure if I will be able to swim 1.9 kilometres in open water.\n                I went to a swimming pool and consulted a coach. He told me that I will be able to swim 1.9 kilometres\n                in 6 months if I practice regularly. I was not sure if I will be able to do it but I was ready to give it a try.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n                I started training for swimming, and within a month I was able to swim 50m without stopping.\n                It game me confidence that I will be able to do it.\n                <br />\n                <br />\n                Finally, I made my mind and signed up for Ironman 70.3 Goa in April 2022. I had six months to train for it.\n                 I was excited and nervous at the same time.\n                I was excited because I was going to do something that I have never done before and nervous because I was not sure if I will be able to do it.\n                <br />\n                <br />\n                I started training for swimming, biking and running. I was training 6 days a week and I was enjoying it.\n                I was enjoying the process of training and pushing my body to the limit.\n                <br />\n                <br />\n                I will be sharing my training experience in the next post.\n                <br />\n                <br />\n\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Page;\n"],"names":["_ref","name","className","onClick","style","ext","split","React","src","heading","headingClass","bodyClass","sideComponent","sideImg","sideClass","sideImgClassName","id","children","styleVars","page","xl","Icon","props","isContactOpen","setContact","useState","Layout","headerClass","SEO","title","description","image","class","minHeight","SectionBox","fontSize","fontStyle","width","maxWidth","textAlign","display"],"sourceRoot":""}
