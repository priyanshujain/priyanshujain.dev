That trip inspired me to sign up for a long-dreamed mountaineering course at HMI (Himalayan Mountaineering Institute) in Darjeeling. Later in the year, I completed the course, diving deep into the technicalities of mountaineering, rock climbing, practicing on the Rathong Glacier, and even climbing the 5,000m Mount Renok. It was a transformative experience that taught me resilience, teamwork, and the sheer joy of pushing physical and mental boundaries.",a.createElement("br",null),a.createElement("br",null),"The year began on a high note with my long due promotion to Principal Engineer.

Beyond running, I ventured into new territories. For the first time, I joined a gym and managed to stick with it for three months straight, thanks to my trainer Lobo, whose guidance and motivation kept me consistent. In the outdoors, I explored the trails of South India through multiple small treks and took on another Himalayan trek in Himachal.

These moments reinforced my love for the mountains and the fulfillment that comes from embracing nature’s challenges.",a.createElement("br",null),a.createElement("br",null),"On the professional front, one of my proudest achievements this year was building an ERP software for one of India’s largest telecom distributors.
