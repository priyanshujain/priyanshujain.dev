While I was there, I met a ton of people — there's a huge community of open water swimmers in Bangalore.",n.createElement("br",null),n.createElement("br",null),"Some folks were planning a trip to Vani Vilas Dam in Chitradurga (about 150 km from Bangalore) for an open water swim. The idea honestly scared me. I mean — a dam? That's crazy. I'd normally avoid something like that. But somehow, I let myself get convinced. I decided to take a chance.",n.createElement("br",null),n.createElement("br",null),"I hitchhiked with someone from the group and we made it to Chitradurga after a 150 km drive. We stayed at GETHNAA (General Thimayya National Adventure Academy) — a professional training camp I hadn't expected at all. The accommodations were simple but comfortable, with large rooms and bunk beds. They provided us with great South Indian food (we washed our own dishes afterwards — a nice community feeling).",n.createElement("br",null),n.createElement("br",null),"The next day, we went down to the backwaters. It was wild — I couldn't see the end of it; it honestly looked more like an ocean. The water was not clear at all, even though it's a drinking water source for the area.",n.createElement("br",null),n.createElement("br",null),"I started by warming up with 500m near the starting deck. They had a jetty boat we could reach if we got tired. There were so many people there — even two 12-year-old boys — which really motivated me. I decided to go for it. I carried two energy gels (thanks to my tri suit's pocket) and kept following the group for more than two hours.",n.createElement("br",null),n.createElement("br",null),"All the years of running had kept up my endurance. This entire experience reminded me of all the training I'd gotten in the pool — from sighting to sculling, and all the instructions from my coach. Sculling really helped me stay afloat when I paused to consume a gel mid-swim.",n.createElement("br",null),n.createElement("br",null),"Once we started to see the other side — some kind of an island — I checked my watch. It seemed I'd crossed more than 3 km in nearly 3 hours! This was huge — my max distance in the pool was 1.5 km with breaks, and now I'd gone much farther in the open water. I honestly couldn't believe it. I even double-checked with other people's watches just to be sure.",n.createElement("br",null),n.createElement("br",null),"On the way back, we used the boat — and surprisingly, they had arranged breakfast for us, right there on the jetty! We had a hearty meal in the middle of the dam, with water all around us. I was so hungry I ate a ton! Sun was so high so we took a few photos and then went back to the camp.",n.createElement("br",null),n.createElement("br",null),"We rested in the afternoon and later went sightseeing — we did a small trek, visited a few wind turbine sites, and saw the dam from up high. It was wild to look down and realize we'd crossed it ourselves just the day before.",n.createElement("br",null),n.createElement("br",null),"In the afternoon, we did even more water activities — kayaking, banana boating, and jet skiing — a lot of pure fun.",n.createElement("br",null),n.createElement("br",null),"The following day, after breakfast, we headed back to Bangalore.
