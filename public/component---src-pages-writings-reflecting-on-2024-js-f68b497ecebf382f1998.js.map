That trip inspired me to\n              sign up for a long-dreamed mountaineering course at HMI (Himalayan\n              Mountaineering Institute) in Darjeeling. Later in the year, I\n              completed the course, diving deep into the technicalities of\n              mountaineering, rock climbing, practicing on the Rathong Glacier,\n              and even climbing the 5,000m Mount Renok. It was a transformative\n              experience that taught me resilience, teamwork, and the sheer joy\n              of pushing physical and mental boundaries.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              The year began on a high note with my long due promotion to\n              Principal Engineer. It’s been a journey, filled with challenges\n              that allowed me to grow and contribute meaningfully to my field.\n              <br />\n              2024 was also special because I got to celebrate my leap-year\n              birthday on February 29th. It’s not every year you get to throw a\n              birthday party—literally once in four years! Surrounded by\n              friends, it was a memorable day that reminded me of the importance\n              of cherishing relationships.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              While I participated in fewer running races this year, I stuck to\n              my staples: the TCS World 10K, the Bangalore 10K Challenge, and\n              the Bangalore Marathon. Beyond running, I ventured into new\n              territories. For the first time, I joined a gym and managed to\n              stick with it for three months straight, thanks to my trainer\n              Lobo, whose guidance and motivation kept me consistent. In the\n              outdoors, I explored the trails of South India through multiple\n              small treks and took on another Himalayan trek in Himachal. The\n              experience of repelling for the first time gave me a thrilling\n              taste of mountaineering. These moments reinforced my love for the\n              mountains and the fulfillment that comes from embracing nature’s\n              challenges.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              On the professional front, one of my proudest achievements this\n              year was building an ERP software for one of India’s largest\n              telecom distributors. The pilot, developed in just two weeks,\n              convinced them to switch from Tally, a traditional ERP tool. The\n              project was a testament to the power of simple and quality\n              software to address real-world problems.\n              <br />\n              I also ventured back into the world of open-source, contributing,\n              giving talks at tech meetups in Bangalore. It had been a while\n              since I stood in front of an audience, but sharing insights on\n              cloud infrastructure cost management and security rekindled my\n              passion for community engagement.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              This year, I also finally set up a home lab with two Intel mini\n              computers (NUCs). It was a fun and geeky project where I\n              experimented with running multiple services. It felt great to\n              create a dedicated space for tinkering and learning.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              This year marked a period of renewal in many ways. After four\n              years, I upgraded my devices, moving from an iPhone 12 to a 16 and\n              from a MacBook Pro M1 (2020) to an M3 (2024). These upgrades\n              reminded me of the importance of investing in tools that enable us\n              to perform at our best. Welcoming my brother into the apartment\n              was another meaningful change. Creating a space for him brought a\n              sense of family connection.\n              <br />\n              Finally, I undertook a big renovation project of my apartment,\n              giving it a fresh new look and decluttering by giving away a lot\n              of stuff. This project not only revitalized my living space but\n              also brought a sense of simplicity to my everyday life.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              I always wanted to learn a new language and towards the end of the\n              year, I started learning German. This turned into an unexpected\n              obsession. I went all in into language learning practicing 6-8\n              hours a day, completing the A1 level in just two weeks.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              Reflecting on 2024, I am grateful for the opportunities, the\n              challenges, and the growth that came my way. It was a year of\n              transformation, of pushing boundaries, and embracing new\n              experiences. As I look ahead, I am excited about the possibilities\n              that 2025 holds, the new challenges, and the adventures that\n              await.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Page;\n"],"names":["_ref","heading","headingClass","bodyClass","sideComponent","sideImg","sideClass","className","sideImgClassName","id","children","React","styleVars","page","xl","Icon","name","props","isContactOpen","setContact","useState","Layout","headerClass","SEO","title","description","class","style","minHeight","SectionBox"],"sourceRoot":""}
