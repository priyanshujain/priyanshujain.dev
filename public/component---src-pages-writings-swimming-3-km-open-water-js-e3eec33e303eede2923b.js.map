I mean — a dam? That's crazy. I'd normally avoid something like that.\n              But somehow, I let myself get convinced. I decided to take a chance.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              I hitchhiked with someone from the group and we made it to Chitradurga after a 150 km drive.\n              We stayed at GETHNAA (General Thimayya National Adventure Academy) — a professional training camp I hadn't expected at all.\n              The accommodations were simple but comfortable, with large rooms and bunk beds.\n              They provided us with great South Indian food (we washed our own dishes afterwards — a nice community feeling).\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              The next day, we went down to the backwaters. It was wild — I couldn't see the end of it; it honestly looked more like an ocean.\n              The water was not clear at all, even though it's a drinking water source for the area.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              I started by warming up with 500m near the starting deck. They had a jetty boat we could reach if we got tired.\n              There were so many people there — even two 12-year-old boys — which really motivated me.\n              I decided to go for it. I carried two energy gels (thanks to my tri suit's pocket) and kept following the group for more than two hours.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              All the years of running had kept up my endurance.\n              This entire experience reminded me of all the training I'd gotten in the pool — from sighting to sculling, and all the instructions from my coach.\n              Sculling really helped me stay afloat when I paused to consume a gel mid-swim.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              Once we started to see the other side — some kind of an island — I checked my watch.\n              It seemed I'd crossed more than 3 km in nearly 3 hours!\n              This was huge — my max distance in the pool was 1.5 km with breaks, and now I'd gone much farther in the open water.\n              I honestly couldn't believe it. I even double-checked with other people's watches just to be sure.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              On the way back, we used the boat — and surprisingly, they had arranged breakfast for us, right there on the jetty!\n              We had a hearty meal in the middle of the dam, with water all around us. I was so hungry I ate a ton!\n              Sun was so high so we took a few photos and then went back to the camp.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              We rested in the afternoon and later went sightseeing — we did a small trek, visited a few wind turbine sites, and saw the dam from up high.\n              It was wild to look down and realize we'd crossed it ourselves just the day before.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              In the afternoon, we did even more water activities — kayaking, banana boating, and jet skiing — a lot of pure fun.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              The following day, after breakfast, we headed back to Bangalore.\n              It was a super-memorable trip — I won't forget it.\n              It's my longest swim to this date.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Page;"],"names":["_ref","heading","headingClass","bodyClass","sideComponent","sideImg","sideClass","className","sideImgClassName","id","children","React","styleVars","page","xl","Icon","name","props","isContactOpen","setContact","useState","Layout","headerClass","SEO","title","description","class","style","minHeight","SectionBox"],"sourceRoot":""}
